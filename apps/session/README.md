## 📁 Project Structure

Following **Feature-Sliced Design**, the codebase is modular and organized around features and domain entities.

```
src/
├── app/           # App-level config and providers (Redux, routing, theming)
├── pages/         # Full pages or large parts of a page in nested routing
├── widgets/       # Reusable UI parts composed of features and entities (IssueList, UserProfile, etc.)  (optional)
├── features/      # Reused implementations of entire product features (e.g., SendComment, AddToCart, UserSearch)
├── entities/      # Core domain models (e.g., user, vendor, blog)
└── shared/        # Reusable components, UI, hooks, utils
```
